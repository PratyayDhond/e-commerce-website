This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\r\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\r\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\r\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\r\n *\r\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\r\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\r\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\r\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\r\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\r\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\r\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\r\n * primary.\r\n *\r\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\r\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\r\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\r\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\r\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\r\n * persistence.\r\n *\r\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\r\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\r\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\r\n *\r\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\r\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\r\n * operations will automatically fail.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\r\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\r\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\r\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\r\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\r\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\r\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\r\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n *\r\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\r\n * longer optional.\r\n */\r\nclass zr {\r\n    constructor(\r\n    /**\r\n     * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\r\n     * access to local persistence.\r\n     */\r\n    t, e, n, s, i, r, o, u, a, \r\n    /**\r\n     * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.

The Query Engine determines\r\n * what mode to use based on what data is persisted. The mode only determines\r\n * the runtime complexity of the query - the result set is equivalent across all\r\n * implementations.\r\n *\r\n * The Query engine will use indexed-based execution if a user has configured\r\n * any index that can be used to execute query (via `setIndexConfiguration()`).\r\n * Otherwise, the engine will try to optimize the query by re-using a previously\r\n * persisted query result. If that is not possible, the query will be executed\r\n * via a full collection scan.\r\n *\r\n * Index-based execution is the default when available. The query engine\r\n * supports partial indexed execution and merges the result from the index\r\n * lookup with documents that have not yet been indexed. The index evaluation\r\n * matches the backend's format and as such, the SDK can use indexing for all\r\n * queries that the backend supports.\r\n *\r\n * If no index exists, the query engine tries to take advantage of the target\r\n * document mapping in the TargetCache. These mappings exists for all queries\r\n * that have been synced with the backend at least once and allow the query\r\n * engine to only read documents that previously matched a query plus any\r\n * documents that were edited after the query was last listened to.\r\n *\r\n * There are some cases when this optimization is not guaranteed to produce\r\n * the same results as full collection scans. In these cases, query\r\n * processing falls back to full scans. These cases are:\r\n *\r\n * - Limit queries where a document that matched the query previously no longer\r\n *   matches the query.\r\n *\r\n * - Limit queries where a document edit may cause the document to sort below\r\n *   another document that is in the local cache.\r\n *\r\n * - Queries that have never been CURRENT or free of limbo documents.\r\n */ class to {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        this.Xs = !1;\r\n    }\r\n    /** Sets the document view to query against. */    initialize(t, e) {\r\n        this.Zs = t, this.indexManager = e, this.Xs = !0;\r\n    }\r\n    /** Returns all local documents matching the specified query. */    Qs(t, e, n, s) {\r\n        return this.ti(t, e).next((i => i || this.ei(t, e, s, n))).next((n => n || this.ni(t, e)));\r\n    }\r\n    /**\r\n     * Performs an indexed query that evaluates the query based on a collection's\r\n     * persisted index values.
